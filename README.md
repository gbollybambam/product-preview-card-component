This is a solution to the Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor. Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

This project focuses on building a responsive product card using best practices in semantic HTML and mobile-first CSS.

### The Challenge

The goal was to build out the component to look as close to the design as possible, ensuring it is fully responsive, transitioning from a stacked layout on mobile devices to a two-column layout on desktop screens.

### Key Learning & Best Practices Used

* **Semantic HTML5:** Utilizing elements like `<article>`, `<picture>`, and `<del>` for better accessibility and structure.

* **Mobile-First Workflow:** Styling for small screens first and using CSS Media Queries (`@media (min-width: 650px)`) to progressively enhance the layout for larger viewports.

* **CSS Custom Properties (Variables):** Defining colors, fonts, and spacing in the `:root` for maintainability and consistency.

* **Modern Layout:** Using **CSS Grid** for the main desktop layout (two columns) and **Flexbox** for internal alignments (like the price group and the button content).

* **External Fonts:** Correctly loading custom Google Fonts (Montserrat & Fraunces) via link tags.

## Tools and Technologies

* **HTML5** (Semantic Structure)

* **CSS3** (Mobile-First, Flexbox, Grid, Custom Properties)
